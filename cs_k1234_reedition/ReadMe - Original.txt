<>//INTRODUCING...
I would like to introduce You map called cs_k1234_reedition. The name is not by lack of idea.
Each room has special ID. K1,K2,Server,K3,K4. The rooms layout are used from real building
but I mixed it a little and added more ways to rooms to avoid big camping.This version was made from 0!

<>///MAP BRIEFING:
*Terrorists make assault on Zamsig Inc. and got hostages.
*Counter Terrorists have to clear area from danger, and rescue hostages.
*Counter Terrorists are better prepared, and can get 12x Kevlar with helmet from start.
*They are lying on ammo boxes. They also got "Breaching charge"
put next to K4.
*Confused terrorists have to prevent from capturing hostages at all costs. 
*Terrorists can take advantage by capturing vents, - ladder in generator room.


<>////SAFETY and TRUSTY...
This is the SECOND and THE LAST right map by this name: cs_k1234 serie# (from my person). 
If you are not sure to download this on other sites, pick the gamebanana. Its most recommended site,
and safe too : ). Remember that most of SITES try to do the trick with SENDIND MESSAGES to unlock
DOWNLOAD. DO NOT USE THEM. The download is free. Making credits for this will be punished!
If you WANT to edit this ASK me. Anyone who wants to try his mapping skills, please call me that you want
to use the map layout. 


<>/////CONCLUSION
I made this map cause, I had to try my skills in Valve Hammer Editor. The original purpose of "cs_k1234" was
to make a building part from school to play like in real counter-terrorists assault on familiar place. Additionaly,
when I was making vertical projection of building, I got an idea to put this awesome layout into my favourite
game. Of course the real one doesn't have "Generator Room" and "Big vent system". I had to make it more
interesting, because one way to hostages would be big disaster. I am glad that I made this map.
Now I am gonna play with friends on it a little, so let me share this one with you. Maybe few of You will 
enjoy this! Greetings to Counter Strike veterans! I almost forgot - for people who want to try their skills 
in VHE but they dont know how to begin. First learn some 'verticall' positioning and planning on easy
map builder - WorldCraft online. If you will be done, take control of Valve-tool. Precision learned from 
browse-builder will allow you to make your next maps more accurate and less-bugged! Do not worry if you
do not know how to operate in this program! There are many tutorials, but personally I tell you that it is 
much better to learn this program on your own. Use only the tips that people share about skybox etc.

Greetings,
Pavlos!








Map made by Pavlos, Enjoy!
