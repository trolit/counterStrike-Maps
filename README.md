Under this repository you will find map that I created in VHE (cs_k1234_reedition). What is VHE (Valve Hammer Editor)? <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor">find out here</a>. In few words, its
tool to make maps for Source Engine games like Counter Strike. This experience was very useful before 
moving to Unity environment. Take a look how big difference is between cs_k1234 and cs_k1234_reedition. 
First map was made in web browser (it was literally my first approach to level design) and the second one in VHE.
Azteco skirmish was also created in web browser.

### From cs_k1234_reedition readme
```
I would like to introduce You map called cs_k1234_reedition. The name is not by lack of idea. Each room
has special ID. K1,K2,Server,K3,K4. The rooms layout are used from real building but I mixed it a little
and added more ways to rooms to avoid big camping.This version was made from 0!

I made this map cause, I had to try my skills in Valve Hammer Editor. The original purpose of "cs_k1234" was
to make a building part from school to play like in real counter-terrorists assault on familiar place.
Additionaly, when I was making vertical projection of building, I got an idea to put this awesome layout into
my favourite game. Of course the real one doesn't have "Generator Room" and "Big vent system". I had to make 
it more interesting, because one way to hostages would be big disaster. I am glad that I made this map.
Now I am gonna play with friends on it a little, so let me share this one with you. Maybe few of You will 
enjoy this! Greetings to Counter Strike veterans! I almost forgot - for people who want to try their skills 
in VHE but they dont know how to begin. First learn some 'verticall' positioning and planning on easy
map builder - WorldCraft online. If you will be done, take control of Valve-tool. Precision learned from 
browse-builder will allow you to make your next maps more accurate and less-bugged! Do not worry if you
do not know how to operate in this program! There are many tutorials, but personally I tell you that it is 
much better to learn this program on your own. Use only the tips that people share about skybox etc.

Greetings,
Pavlos!
